- City list verified against [Wikipedia article](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8).


Comments:

- `Белоозерский` not found in Rosstat publication, but [should be considered 
a city as of 1.1.2020](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/ru-cities/issues/5#issuecomment-886179980)

- Several notable towns are classified as administrative part of larger cities (eg `Сестрорецк` is a municpality at  `Санкт-Петербург`) and not reported in this dataset.

- `Дмитриев` and `Дмитриев-Льговский` are the same city.
